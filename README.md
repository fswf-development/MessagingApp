# MessagingApp

This application was developed by a team of student developers enrolled in the first Java Programming Bootcamp held by Grand Canyon University in the Spring 2018.

Any users of the code or application should be aware that it was developed only as a proof-of-concept exercise as part of the bootcamp studentsâ€™ final project.
No guarantees were made as to performance, availability, and reliability of the application by either the students themselves, the bootcamp instruction staff, or Grand Canyon University.  However, every effort was made by the development team to produce a functional and usable application that FSWF can use with a minimum of future support and changes.

The messaging application was developed with the following technologies or services:

Technology:
  Node.js, JavaScript
  Pug, HTML, CSS ,Bootstrap
  MongoDB

Services:
  Heroku.com (Application hosting)
  Mongodb.com (Database hosting)
